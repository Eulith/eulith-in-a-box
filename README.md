# Eulith In a Box
This repo contains a standalone docker image (`eulith-devrpc`) 
that can be used to test your integration with Eulith.

When you run `eulith-devrpc`, you get:
1. A local Anvil development chain
2. The full Eulith webserver
3. Trivial forking support for Ethereum Mainnet and Goerli
4. Pre-funded wallets with ETH and WETH

ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ NOTE: Using this service WILL NOT consume any real ETH or GoerliETH. 
That's the whole point of having a dev binary like this. ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

# Dependency
### Docker
You must have docker installed and running to use this tool.

You can find out how to install docker here: https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/

# Run
`./start.sh`

If you would like to force an update of the docker image, run `./start.sh -r`

If you need help, run `./start.sh -h` or get in touch with us

### Credentials
The built-in Eulith user can be authenticated with:

Username: `libtest`
Password: `test`

The private key for the pre-funded wallet is `0x4d5db4107d237df6a3d58ee5f70ae63d73d7658d4026f2eefd2f204c81682cb7`

### Forking (ETH Mainnet & Goerli)
You can trivially (at least we think so) fork Mainnet and Goerli.

When you run the start script, just add:

1. `-c` : chain id (1 for ETH Mainnet, 5 for Goerli)
2. `-b` : block number

Examples:

`./start.sh -c 1 -b 16327616` fork Mainnet, block number 16327616

`./start.sh -c 5 -b 90000` fork Goerli, block number 90000

### Troubleshooting
If the server fails to start, try removing any fork functionality. The fork
takes longer to boot up and will fail silently if you give it an invalid
block ID.

If it still fails with no forking, please get in touch and let us know what the
problem is. Thanks!

# Shutdown
1. Run `docker container ls`
2. Find the container ID, and kill with `docker container stop <CONTAINER_ID>`

shut down the process and restart, YOUR LOCAL ACTIONS WILL 
NOT PERSIST ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
